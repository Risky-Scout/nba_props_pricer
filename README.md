## Run
From this folder:
```
python scripts/prop_pricer.py
```
Result: `results/priced_props.csv` with fair + market probabilities/odds.

## Refreshing data fast
- Update `data/prop_calculator.csv` with:
  - team/opponent pace, FG%, FGA, FTA (to compute FTr), FT% for both teams
  - player RPG/MPG and minutes scenario
- You can keep `gamma_reb_ft=0` to ignore FT rebound contributions (safe), or set to `0.05â€“0.12` later.
- Edit `league_*` constants in code top or add a config file if you prefer published league averages.
